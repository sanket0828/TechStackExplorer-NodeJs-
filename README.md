# Node.js Product Catalog (Learning Project)

A vanilla **Node.js** project built to understand how backend systems work **without using any frameworks**.

This application serves a small product catalog (tech tools instead of food items) using **server-side rendering**, HTML templates, and JSON data. It dynamically generates overview and product detail pages using only Node.js core modules.

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

- Creating an HTTP server using Node.js core modules
- Manual routing without Express
- Parsing URLs and query parameters
- Reading and serving data from JSON files
- Server-side templating using string replacement
- Dynamic HTML generation
- Conditional rendering based on data (e.g. Open Source badge)
- Defensive error handling to avoid runtime crashes

## 🧠 Why This Project

Instead of starting with frameworks like Express, this project was intentionally built using **raw Node.js** to strengthen core backend fundamentals.  
Understanding these basics makes it easier to work with frameworks and reason about real-world backend behavior.
